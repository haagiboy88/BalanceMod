Trying to create a racing mod that will fill the gap between seeded and unseeded racing.

The goal is to create a mod where everyone instantly starts with the same starting item, but on different seeds.
You are NOT allowed to reset for better treasure room on B1, you HAVE to go with the seed that is first generated to you.

I have absolutely no idea how to enforce this, but maybe it is possible to use something like Eden, where holding R to reset is not possible. If I can't find a workaround, you'll just have to trust your fellow racers to not cheat by resetting :)

Otherwise the itempools, rooms etc etc are the same as the ones in Zamiels Jud6's mod (v1.18 at this moment)

# Rules: 

Reseting is not allowed

If you die, .forfeit

If all racers die, .rematch

Rules are up for discussion to improve them!

# Balance Mod

Balance Mod is a racing mod for *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth*.
